**Which framework would you like added to this project**
- framework name
- link to academic paper

**Why should this framework be added?**
What benefit is there to adding this framework?

**Short summary of framework**
What is the core algorithmic idea behind the framework in simple terms. Please give a general overview rather than advanced algorithmic concepts.
- eg. The beta-VAE weights the regularisation term, aiming to improve disentanglement.
- e.g The DFC-VAE augments the reconstruction loss of the VAE/beta-VAE with a perceptual loss.

**Which framework does this build upon, if any?**
eg. the beta-VAE extends the standard VAE
eg. the Adaptive VAEs extend the beta-VAE

**Are you willing to submit a PR?**
Are you willing to work on this implementation and submit a PR?
